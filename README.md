# wordclock
a python script that shows the time and weekday in a text square.

i didnt write this, and i dont know who the original creator was, but i got the code from [Cveinnt](https://github.com/Cveinnt/ "Cveinnt").

i changed the weekdays order, but you can use the traditional order by changing the `+` to `-` in line 60; and `SSMTWTFQNKMI` to `MTWTFSSQNKMI` in line 48.

you can use it in your rices, maybe. or whatever else, no copyright for me.
